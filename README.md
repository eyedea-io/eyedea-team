# EYEDEA at a glance 

We are EYEDEA: a cross-disciplinary product-oriented team. Maciej Kucharz founded our company in 2015. Since then, we are using a diverse set of skills to help our Norwegian clients in building their digital products. We have established Norwegian and Polish entities.

## How do we work?

We are different from a traditional software house - we don't like to burn your time and money. Our main goal for each project we're working on is to deliver the best possible value and experience for both: you, and the end-user. We are starting with problem validation, ending up on reaching product-market fit. 

Working with us means that you will deal with the following principles.

### Transparency

Our product development process is entirely transparent. You will get access to design, code and hour reports. To make your life easier, we will send you a weekly update newsletter with a summary of project progress with hour reports and most exciting updates. You will not be surprised with hidden or unpredictable costs.

### Open communication 

No more messy e-mail threads / private messages. We are using Slack for daily communication. You will get access to the channel where the whole team can discuss ongoing matters.

### Product-oriented thinking

We like to be sure that we're building the right thing, that's why we are using our method of creating digital products - [Flow](http://flowplatform.io). It guides every team member towards the goal smoothly. We are used to discussing problems and finding solutions instead of blindly executing the client's ideas. 

### EYEDEA PROJECT 101
